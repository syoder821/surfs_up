# Surfs Up Project

## Overview of analysis
An initial analysis of the weather trends for the clients prefered location of new surf and ice cream shop was delivered.  The client was pleased with the analysis, but has asked for more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, the client wants temperature data for the months of Decemeber and June in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Anaconda virtual environment Python Jupyter notebook 

## Results:
A statistical analysis was preformed on the temperature data for the months of Decemeber and June that is shown below.

### Key weather differences between December and June
- The average temperature in both months is greater than 71 degrees with June being ~ 4 degrees warmer.
- The minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees while June minimum temperature is 8 degrees warmer.
- There are ~ 15% more temperature data points for June vs. Decemeber.
- The maximum temperature for June is slightly higher than December, 2 degrees.

## Summary
Although the average temperatue in June is 4 degrees warmer the temperature of both months are conducive to supporting a surf and ice cream shop year round.  
Two additional data sets that would be useful to provide would be the precipitation statistics for each month as these would have a bearing on how often people would visit a surf and ice cream shop.
